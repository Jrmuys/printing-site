          The Thrifty Bot owns and operates multiple Markforged Onyx One desktop
          3D printers. This allows us to create parts made from Markforged Onyx.
          Onyx has a flexural strength of 81 MPa (11.7 ksi) and is very robust.
          Onyx has an extraordinarily high strength to weight ratio and an ultra
          smooth surface finish, which makes it ideal for competitive robotics.
          For more information on Onyx, see the
